stack provides 4 functions:                                  Queue provides 4 functions
1.push(x)                                                    push(x)
2.pop()                                                      pop()
3.top()                                                      top()
4.size()                                                     size()

No need to write functions for above 4 operations, there is inbuilt functions(internal libraries) in every language
